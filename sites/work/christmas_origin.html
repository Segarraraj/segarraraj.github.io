                    The goal of Christmas Origin was to make a 3D Platformer for a project in one of the subjects of our second year at ESAT.
                    The team was formed by me and other 2 programmers. And the visual art and sounds were from free packs on the internet.

                    I was mostly in charge of the UI (I would say thay my UI/UX skills have improved since there) and ther procedural mode.
                    The rules to create the procedural map were quite simple, just pick random pieces from a given pool without turning more than 90 degrees of the original rotation.
                    And the mode itslef was also simple, there was a ball behind you that was slightly slower than you, the tiles touched by that ball were hidden and new ones were moved and showed at the tip of the map.

                    While I was doing the procedural map and UI, my teammate <a class="mention" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikel-mondragon-55146a201/" target="_blank">Mikel Mondragon</a> was in charge of the AI/traps and the Character movement, meanwhile <a class="mention" href="" target="_blank">Borja Serrano</a> was focused on making puzzles in a more design driven map.
