                    This game was made during a game jam in the ESAT in the second year, we were a group of 4 programmers and 3 artists, and it was the first time that we worked all together with real artists. The theme of the game jam was two objects and we hadn't more limitations than that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since it was a game jam of just 48 hours, we hadn't that much time, we dedicated the first morning of the jam to think and design the idea an mechanics of the game, while spending the afternoon to program them and make the different props.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second day was quite different, was mostly dedicated to merge the actual game with the art of our beloved artist did, since it was the first time for all of us that task gave us a lot of problems, also we had to spend some time to polish the mechanics we did the day before and finally dressing the levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we (the programmers) weren't prepared for dressing a level (and we all know, our sense of art is barely non existant) we finished polising the different mechaniics, adding music or making the main menu, while the artists finished adding their art to the levels.
