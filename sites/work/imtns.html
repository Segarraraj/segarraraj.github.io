                <p>This project was an assignment of my last year in saxion. We had 5 months to deliver a prototype/product based on real client specifications. We worked as part of the European <a href="" class="mention" target="_blank">ACuTe project</a> instead of a specific client, developing what we thought it could be a possible addon to future theatres.</p>

                <p>In the beginning, we were focusing on the problem with the old fashion mindset, looking into possible uses of new technologies in theatres, but after not finding much we decided to make what we were good at, games. Envisioning a multiplayer VR interactive game where players can perform/roleplay based on a given or chosen character with its goals and traits, a part of the players other people will be able to join the session to spectate and look around.</p>

                <p>During those 5 months, we worked as a multidisciplinary team, formed by 2 artists, 1 designer, and 2 programmers. I mainly work in the network part and Unity Inverse Kinematics, doing also the little UI work present in the prototype. Leaving the VR interactions and others to my teammates.</p>
                <p>We decided to use Photon Fusion after my <a href="photon_pun_demo.html" target="_blank">short project with Photon Pun</a>. The major change with Fusion is that the server has the authority (unless you run it in shared mode) over netwrok objects. And I think that was the major issue, as the objects picked by clients VR controllers were a bit clunky and laggy on their headsets because the position was being set by the server.</p>
